I got tired of having to hunt things down around the internet when it comes to hacking the pokewalker, so I made this to solve that problem.

# Current Main Tools:
The following tools/programs are what I think the easiest way to go about doing everything currently possible with the pokewalker, but by no mean every program that can be used in hacking the pokewalker

> **Walker Flow:** A python based program that can handle converting image files, make custom IR signals, and make custom routes through AR codes.
> *Download:*

> **PwalkerHax:** A 3Ds app that can send items, pokemon, steps, and watts while also being able to dump the pokewalker's ROM and save file directly through the 3Ds's IR port.
> *Download:* https://github.com/francesco265/pwalkerHax

> **Tinker:** A program that allows you to edit the files within your HG/SS game, mainly the pokemon sprites that appear on the pokewalker.
> *Download:* https://github.com/pleonex/tinke

> **DSPRE Reloaded:** A gen 4 rom editor that allows you to change the names and descriptions of every route on the pokewalker.
> *Download:* https://github.com/AdAstra-LD/DS-Pokemon-Rom-Editor
